# Distributed storage systems and the CAP theorem

The project explores both centralized and decentralized architectures for distributed storage systems, addressing the CAP theorem's implications. 
Through gRPC implementation and API design, it ensures efficient communication and coordination among nodes, while emphasizing consistency, availability, and fault tolerance.

## Features

- **Centralized:** Implementation of the server cluster with a master node and slave nodes for cloud data storage.
- **Decentralized:**  Implementation of a decentralized architecture without a master node, where all nodes collaborate for data storage.

## Use
-  **Centralized:** Execute python file centralized.py
-  **Decentralized:** Execute python file decentralized.py
